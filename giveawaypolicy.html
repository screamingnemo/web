 <h1>Monthly Giveaway Terms and Conditions</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Screaming Nemo Monthly Giveaway is a recurring promotion in which one eligible participant is randomly selected at the end of each calendar month to receive a free item, redeemed via a promo code. The giveaway item may be official Screamin' Nemo merchandise or a product from a partner brand.</p>
  <p>Participation is freeâ€”no purchase is necessary to enter or win, and making a purchase does not increase your chances. To remain eligible, participants must meet the engagement requirement by opening at least one marketing email from Screaming Nemo Limited Liability Company within the 30-day period prior to winner selection.</p>
  <p>The selected winner will receive a unique, non-transferable promo code via email. This code is valid for 14 days from the date of issue and covers the full cost of the giveaway item, including shipping. The promo code cannot be combined with any other discounts or offers. Unused or expired promo codes are forfeited and will not be reissued.</p>
  <p>By accepting the prize, the winner agrees to allow Screaming Nemo Limited Liability Company to publicly share their social media username or first name for promotional purposes, unless prohibited by law. Use of bots, fake identities, or multiple email addresses will result in immediate disqualification.</p>
  <p>These terms may be updated, modified, or terminated at any time without prior notice. All disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
  <p>By participating, you acknowledge and agree to all terms outlined below.</p>
