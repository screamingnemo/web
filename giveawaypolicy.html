  <h1>Monthly Giveaway Terms and Conditions</h1>

   <section>
   <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Screaming Nemo Monthly Giveaway is a recurring promotion in which one eligible subscriber is randomly selected at the end of each month to receive a free item, redeemed via a promo code. The giveaway item may be official Screamin' Nemo merchandise or a product from a partner brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participation is free—<strong>no purchase is necessary</strong> to enter or win, and making a purchase does not improve your chances. To remain eligible, subscribers must engage with at least one marketing email during the 30-day period prior to winner selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winner will receive a unique, non-transferable promo code via email, valid for 14 days. The code covers the full cost of the item and includes free shipping. It cannot be combined with other offers, and any unused balance or expired code will be forfeited.
    </p>
    <p>
      By accepting the prize, the participant agrees to allow Screaming Nemo LLC to publicly announce that the partcipant won, unless restricted by law. Abuse of entry—such as using bots or multiple email addresses—will result in disqualification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giveaway terms are subject to change or cancellation at any time, and all disputes must be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      By participating, you agree to the full terms outlined below.
