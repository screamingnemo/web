      <h2>Where It Started</h2>
      <p>It started in a hotel room in 2020 at the height of COVID-19.</p>
      <p>At the time, I was a drunk POS at rock bottom, struggling with addiction just trying to stay alive and figure out what the hell came next.</p>
      <p>Amid all the chaos, of all things, I was intrigued by etymology especially Latin-rooted words.</p>
      <p><strong>Nemo</strong> stood out: nobody, nothing, no one. It just felt right.</p>
      <p>Since then, I have made large strides in recovering, transforming, and building myself and my life.</p>
      <p>Music has always given me something to hold onto, and I will never let it go.</p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>I put words on paper and shape the sound until it matches what’s playing in my head.</p>
      <p>I write songs that pull from jazz, the blues, pop, alternative, and whatever else feels right in the moment.</p>
      <p>Most of what I write is rooted in the human condition. The highs, the lows, the good and the bad, and everything else in between.</p>
      <p>Beyond my own music, I live stream,  dive into current events, technology, society, the world around us, and play video games. </p>
