      <h2>Where It Started</h2>
      <p>It started in a hotel room in 2020 at the height of COVID-19.</p>
      <p>At the time, I was a drunk POS at rock bottom, struggling with addiction just trying to stay alive and figure out what the hell came next.</p>
      <p>Amid all the chaos, of all things, I was intrigued by etymology especially Latin-rooted words.</p>
      <p><strong>Nemo</strong> stood out: nobody, nothing, no one. It just felt right.</p>
      <p>Since then, I have made large strides in recovering, transforming, and building myself and my life.</p>
      <p>Music has always given me something to hold onto, and I will never let it go.</p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>I put words on paper and shape the sound until it matches what’s playing in my head.</p>
      <p>I write songs that pull from jazz, the blues, pop, alternative, and whatever else feels right in the moment.</p>
      <p>Most of what I write is rooted in the human condition. The highs, the lows, the good and the bad, and everything else that define what it means to be human.</p>
      <p>Beyond my own music, I live stream,  dive into current events, technology, society, the world around us, and play video games. </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>We’re all grappling with life’s chaos, making it up along the way through life’s uncertainty. Trying to figure "it" out. Life is messy.</p>
      <p>Making music has been my way to process life’s ups and downs. I hope my songs help you through the tough times and celebrate the good ones.</p>
      <p>Music digs into those real, raw feelings and reminds us we’re not alone.</p>
      <p>I believe we each have a part to play in shaping the world</p>
      <p>The world doesn’t change by accident. It changes when we decide to show up.</p>
      <p>That’s why I donate 50% of the profit from each merch sale to charities and organizations that align with my beliefs and values.</p>
      <p>If we want better, it’s on us to make it happen together.</p>
