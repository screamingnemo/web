      <h2>Where It Started</h2>
      <p>It started in a hotel room in 2020 at the height of COVID-19.</p>
      <p>At the time, I was a drunk POS at rock bottom, struggling with addiction—just trying to stay alive and figure out what the hell came next.</p>
      <p>Amid all the chaos and uncertainty, of all things, I was intrigued by etymology—especially Latin-rooted words.</p>
      <p><strong>Nemo</strong> stood out: nobody, nothing, no one. It just felt right.</p>
      <p>Since then, I have made large strides in recovering, transforming, and building myself and my life.</p>
      <p>Music has always given me something to hold onto, and I will never let it go.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>I write rock ‘n’ roll songs that pull from the blues, pop, alternative, and whatever else feels right in the moment.</p>
      <p>I put words on paper and shape the sound until it matches what’s playing in my head — whatever the feeling.</p>
      <p>Most of what I write is rooted in the human condition—the messy beauty of being alive.</p>
      <p>The highs, the lows, the good and the bad, and everything else that define what it means to be human.</p>
      <p>I make songs that hit hard, hold your hand, move your feet, and help you fall asleep.</p>
      <p>Beyond my own music, I create social media content that promotes other bands and artists.</p>
      <p>I share simple chord progressions behind well-known songs — the same way I learned.</p>
      <p>A strong foundation makes everything else possible, from playing and writing full songs to playing flashy solos.</p>
      <p>On livestreams, I dive into current events, technology, society, the world around us, and play video games — creating a space for open conversation.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>Making music has been my way to process life’s ups and downs—I hope my songs help you through the tough times and celebrate the good ones.</p>
      <p>We’re all grappling with life’s chaos, making it up along the way through life’s uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Music digs into those real, raw feelings and reminds us we’re not alone.</p>
      <p>The struggle with pain, doubt, and trying to figure "it" out. Life is messy.</p>
      <p>With kindness, compassion, and empathy we each have a part to play in shaping the world.</p>
      <p>I believe in human rights, freedom, justice, and the pursuit of happiness for all.</p>
      <p>The world doesn’t change by accident. It changes when we decide to show up.</p>
      <p>That’s why I donate 50% of the profit from each merch sale to charities and organizations that align with my beliefs and values.</p>
      <p>If we want better, it’s on us to make it happen—together.</p>
