  <h1>Terms and Agreements</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <h3>Website Terms:</h3>
    <p>Be cool, don't be shady, don't steal. You can’t use our intellectual property. We do some affiliate marketing, and we’re not responsible for the content or activities of the linked sites.</p>

    <h3>Refund Terms:</h3>
    <p>The merchandise is created on demand. Screaming Nemo doesn't hold inventory at this point in time. Our main supplier of apparel is Printful. Due to how the merchandise is created and distributed, we cannot accept returns or offer refunds for reasons other than manufacturing defects or the order legitimately being lost in the shipping process.</p>

    <h3>Privacy Terms:</h3>
    <p>The information you provide so we can send you cool stuff—we don't hold it for any longer than necessary. If you want us to keep sending you emails about cool stuff, you can opt in or out anytime. When opting out, your information will be wiped from all associated third-party service providers that facilitate digital communications.</p>
